    The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is a special instruction placed at the beginning of an HTML document to
specify the version of HTML being used. It ensures proper rendering and parsing by web browsers. The most
common declaration, <!DOCTYPE html>, indicates the use of HTML5, the latest version of HTML.
