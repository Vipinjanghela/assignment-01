<!--
    Tag:
An HTML tag is a snippet of code enclosed within angle brackets ("<" and ">") that defines the purpose and
structure of a specific element on a webpage. Tags are used to instruct the web browser how to display the
content they enclose. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the
element enclosed within the tags.
